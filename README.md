### [Classifying returning customers](ClassifyingReturningCustomers)
This project centers around predicting with of a company's customers will return in the future. We make use of a dataset containing transaction records for a CD retailer. To make the predictions we employ the [Pareto/NBD](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.33.1.1) and [BG/NBD](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1040.0098) model.
- Software/packages used: `R`, [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), [`BTYD`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BTYD), [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)

### [Recognizing (classifying) doodles of animals](RecognizingDrawings) (In progress)
In this project I use data from the [Quick!, Draw dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) to train a CNN model to recognise drawings of animals.
- Software/packages used: `python`, [`numpy`](https://numpy.org), [`keras`](https://keras.io), [`tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org)

### [Classifying returning customers](ClassifyingReturningCustomers)
This project is centers around predicting with of a company's customers will return in the future. We make use of a dataset containing transaction records for a CD retailer. To make the predictions we employ the [Pareto/NBD](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.33.1.1) and [BG/NBD](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1040.0098) model.
